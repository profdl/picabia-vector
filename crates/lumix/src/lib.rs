//! Picabia camera link (standalone: no other VectorCraft dependencies): drive a Panasonic Lumix
//! camera (first target: the DMC-GX85) over its Wi-Fi remote control, as a fixed animation-stand
//! camera. See `docs/picabia/camera.md`.
//!
//! The protocol is not documented by Panasonic. What this crate does comes from public community
//! notes and is checked against a real camera with the probe (`examples/probe.rs`, PIC34.0);
//! everything that is still a guess is marked *hypothesis* where it is used.
//!
//! # Parts
//! - [`frame`]: the JPEG in a live-view datagram (the datagrams are untrusted: sizes capped, nothing
//!   indexes unchecked).
//! - [`reply`]: a `cam.cgi` XML reply read leniently ([`Reply`]).
//! - [`Controller`]: the protocol as a sans-IO state machine: connect (with the access handshake
//!   when the camera asks for one), record mode, live view, keep-alive, reconnect with backoff,
//!   capture, stop. Replies in with [`Controller::on_reply`], datagrams with
//!   [`Controller::on_datagram`], requests out of [`Controller::poll`], state out of
//!   [`Controller::snapshot`]. Time comes in as `now_ms`, so it runs the same natively, in the
//!   browser build and in tests.
//! - [`Transport`]: where requests and datagrams go ([`pump`] moves them between a transport and a
//!   controller).
//! - [`sim`]: a simulated camera behind the same [`Transport`].
//! - [`ssdp`]: finding cameras on a network (the M-SEARCH request and reading the answers).
//! - `net` (native only): the real transport over `std::net`, and SSDP discovery.
